regex-nfa-cpp
=============

My partial regular expression implementation in CPP -- NFA approach


I did this just for fun, some time ago, and now have no idea what references I used or how far through the project I got.

If I find more info on either I'll put them here :)

I emailed these sources to myself over Jan 12 - Feb 10, 2012
